      <h1>Personally Affected.<br>Passionately Involved.</h1>
      <p>We started working on Kurbi because our loved ones needed us to.</p>

      <div class="body_heading">Every person you know is somehow connected to and affected by at least one chronic disease.</div>
      <div class="body_copy">You may not have noticed it but chronic disease has bullied it’s way into your life. Be it a friend, a loved one, a neighbor, or a coworker; someone you know is battling the affects of chronic disease. Back in 2012 Kurbi co-founder &amp; CEO, Wes Garnett, realized how staggering those statistics are. That knowledge changed the course of his life.
        <br>
        <br>Wes has 5 family members living with the influence of Multiple Sclerosis. His mom was the first to be diagnoised and for years he carried the guilt of feeling like he wasn’t doing enough to support her. What he was suprised to learn was that nearly every family he met with was struggling with similar problems:</div>
      <div class="copy_callout_div">
        <div class="copy_callout_text"><strong>Person living with chronic disease:</strong>&nbsp;
          <br>What can I do with my life now? How do I get back to normal? What’s safe for me to do?
          <br>
          <br><strong>Loved one:&nbsp;</strong>
          <br><strong>I</strong> have no clue what I should be doing to help this person get back to a normal life but I’m pretty sure whatever it is I’m not doing <strong>it</strong>.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="body_copy_3">After doing some research Wes realized that millions of people all over the world were struggling to find answers to the same questions. In 2012 he joined forces with longtime business partner and front-end developer, Steve Reottger; developer/analyst, Andrew Robbins; and architect/developer, Matt Eckman to find a solution.
        <br>
        <br>Today, after a lot of trial and error, Kurbi is helping people to find safe and attainable ways to stay productive despite the affects of chronic disease, track their symptoms, get treatment reminders throughout the day, and access instant, on the fly support from their loved ones, freinds, and care providers.&nbsp;
        <br>
        <br>We believe it’s the intersection of collaborative goal achievement, health tracking, treatment adherence, and increased patient-doctor communication that sets Kurbi apart from other companies in the health and wellness space. We’re truly honored to be at the leading edge of technology-based chronic disease self-management.</div>
